            <p><strong>Hello!</strong> My name is <strong>Samuel</strong> ,  I am Computer Engineering student, who is enrolled in... alot of schools. One is, <a href="https://rhs.rochester.k12.mi.us/">Rochester High School</a>, not my favorite school but definitely a high school. Here is where
            I learn the basics Math, Science, ELA, and History. High school classes in a high school who would've guessed. The Second school is <a href="https://www.ostconline.com/">OSTC-NE</a>, is a technical campus that I learn Computer Programming, Infastructor Design, Team Intagration, and Software Deployment.
            This is by far my favorite education center as I on-site tools and hardware to help me learn new technical skills. Finally, <a href="https://www.oaklandcc.edu/">Oakland Community College</a>, the community college im enrolled in. This school is where I am taking my classes for my Associates in Science degree. Thanks to Oakland Community Schools I can 
            take the Early College program and get ahead of my education for free. I like rainy days and hot cocoa.</p>
